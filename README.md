While many players put their focus on developing technical skills such as strokes, footwork patterns, and serve/receive, very few players place enough attention on the strategic and mental aspects of the sport. 
It is crucial to develop a comprehensive approach to the game that encompasses both technical proficiency and strategic decision-making. 
This research project focuses on using data analysis and computer science to analyze the importance of winning at different scores of a tennis game (0:0, 30:15, 40:40, etc.). 
Using the results of this project, players can realize which points are scientifically most important to win so that they can save essential tactics such as a wide serve or defensive receive for crucial points. 
The guiding research question for this topic is: How does  winning or losing at different scores of a tennis game affect oneâ€™s percentage of winning the game, and how do the significance of different scores relate to one another? 
We hypothesize that the most important score of a tennis game will be 30:30 and that scores which are closer and occur later in the game have higher importance relative to other scores. 
Through the utilization of data analysis and computer science, we will analyze vast quantities of data from professional tennis matches to determine which points have the greatest impact on the outcome of a game. 
In summary, this research project aims to provide tennis players with valuable insights into the strategic importance of winning at different scores. 
By analyzing data from professional tennis matches, we aim to identify the most critical points in a game and help players develop more effective strategies for achieving victory.
